## ✨ Key Features

* **Real-time Gesture Recognition:** Detects hand signs for the English alphabet instantly.
* **Assistive Technology:** Provides a visual aid for communication.
* **Core AI Skills:** Uses Computer Vision and Machine Learning (Random Forest) for hand landmark analysis.

## 🛠️ Technologies

* Python
* MediaPipe
* OpenCV
* scikit-learn
